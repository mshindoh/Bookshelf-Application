# Mizuki's Personal Project

## A Virtual Bookshelf

The virtual bookshelf application **provides the user with an experience similar to using a traditional bookshelf**. 
That means the user can collect data of books in this application and reference them.
The user of the application will be **a person who loves books and gets their books from multiple different places 
such as libraries, book stores and e-book stores**. 
They might want to store information about books in one place 
regardless of where they get the books and whether they can purchase a physical copy or not.

This project interests me because I always struggle to keep track of the books I read. 
I purchase physical books, borrow books from libraries, and purchase e-books. 
However, since I cannot keep e-books and books from the public library in my room, 
it is difficult for me to look back and remember the books I have read in the past. 
For this reason, I always wish to have *a bookshelf which can store all the books I have ever touched with my hands*. 
This application can realize my dream huge bookshelf on my desktop.

## Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time to work on the project, I would 
- make the Book class abstract and include classes that extend Book to represent different kinds of books, such as dictionaries, novels, and music books.
- make the Bookshelf class interface and let a Bookshelf have multiple sections that implement Bookshelf to allow user to switch between sections to organize the bookshelf.
